### Why this project
 This is a project which can be deployed in hospitals for managing things like :-
 1) Creating tokens
 2) Creating unique Patient-id for Patients
 3) Maintaining the queue to the doctor
 4) Creating records of patients diagnosis, prescription, lab-reports
 5) Maintaining the queue to the lab from the doctor
 6) Creating lab reports

### Prerequisites
 1) This project will run only on linux based system as shell scripting has been used in different parts of the project.
    
 2) You also need to have libre office suite as it is the one used to create lab reports.
     - If you are using any other software instead of libre-office, then just change the code in the "lab.h" file, where I used libre-office specific commands.
 3) You also need nautilus.
     - If you use any other file manager just change the code a little bit in the "doctor.h" file by replacing nautilus with your file manager name.
